( arctic_a0001 _AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL, PHILIP STEELS, ETC_ )
( arctic_a0002 _Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore._ )
( arctic_a0003 _For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands._ )
( arctic_a0004 _Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil._ )
( arctic_a0005 _Will we ever forget it._ )
( arctic_a0006 _God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever._ )
( arctic_a0007 _And you always want to see it in the superlative degree._ )
( arctic_a0008 _Gad, your letter came just in time._ )
( arctic_a0009 _He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table._ )
( arctic_a0010 _I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game._ )
( arctic_a0011 _If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now._ )
( arctic_a0012 _Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet._ )
( arctic_a0013 _He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique._ )
( arctic_a0014 _Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed._ )
( arctic_a0015 _It's the aurora borealis._ )
( arctic_a0016 _There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep._ )
( arctic_a0017 _From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy._ )
( arctic_a0018 _There was a change now._ )
( arctic_a0019 _I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances._ )
( arctic_a0020 _Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories._ )
( arctic_a0021 _It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it._ )
( arctic_a0022 _Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition._ )
( arctic_a0023 _A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges._ )
( arctic_a0024 _It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy._ )
( arctic_a0025 _I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed._ )
( arctic_a0026 _It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting._ )
( arctic_a0027 _To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor._ )
( arctic_a0028 _Robbery, bribery, fraud, _ )
( arctic_a0029 _Their forces were already moving into the north country._ )
( arctic_a0030 _I had faith in them._ )
( arctic_a0031 _They were three hundred yards apart._ )
( arctic_a0032 _Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step._ )
( arctic_a0033 _He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson._ )
( arctic_a0034 _Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children._ )
( arctic_a0035 _He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes._ )
( arctic_a0036 _She turned in at the hotel._ )
( arctic_a0037 _I was the only one who remained sitting._ )
( arctic_a0038 _We'll have to watch our chances._ )
( arctic_a0039 _The ship should be in within a week or ten days._ )
( arctic_a0040 _I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here._ )
( arctic_a0041 _Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell._ )
( arctic_a0042 _How could he explain his possession of the sketch._ )
( arctic_a0043 _It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson._ )
( arctic_a0044 _Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip._ )
( arctic_a0045 _He moved away as quietly as he had come._ )
( arctic_a0046 _The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear._ )
( arctic_a0047 _Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog._ )
( arctic_a0048 _He looked at the handkerchief more, closely._ )
( arctic_a0049 _Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin._ )
( arctic_a0050 _In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously._ )
( arctic_a0051 _The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow._ )
( arctic_a0052 _It was a curious coincidence._ )
( arctic_a0053 _Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief._ )
( arctic_a0054 _There was nothing on the rock._ )
( arctic_a0055 _Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound._ )
( arctic_a0056 _Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly._ )
( arctic_a0057 _I have no idea, replied Philip._ )
( arctic_a0058 _I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else._ )
( arctic_a0059 _His immaculate appearance was gone._ )
( arctic_a0060 _Anyway, no one saw her like, that._ )
( arctic_a0061 _Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him._ )
( arctic_a0062 _The men stared into each other's face._ )
( arctic_a0063 _Yes It was a man who asked, a stranger._ )
( arctic_a0064 _The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments._ )
( arctic_a0065 _They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel._ )
( arctic_a0066 _He saw Jeanne falter for a moment._ )
( arctic_a0067 _Surely I will excuse you, she cried._ )
( arctic_a0068 _In a flash Philip followed its direction._ )
( arctic_a0069 _It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father._ )
( arctic_a0070 _He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there._ )
( arctic_a0071 _What was the object of your little sensation._ )
( arctic_a0072 _But who was Eileen's double._ )
( arctic_a0073 _The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them._ )
( arctic_a0074 _Now he held the whip-hand, Brokaw had acknowledged his own surrender._ )
( arctic_a0075 _And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him._ )
( arctic_a0076 _There has been a change, she interrupted him._ )
( arctic_a0077 _The gray eyes faltered, the flush deepened._ )
( arctic_a0078 _It is the fire, partly, she said._ )
( arctic_a0079 _The door opened behind them and Brokaw entered._ )
( arctic_a0080 _Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her._ )
( arctic_a0081 _It was a large canoe._ )
( arctic_a0082 _What if Jeanne failed him._ )
( arctic_a0083 _What if she did not come to the rock._ )
( arctic_a0084 _His face was streaming with blood._ )
( arctic_a0085 _A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes._ )
( arctic_a0086 _Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open._ )
( arctic_a0087 _A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face._ )
( arctic_a0088 _Death had come with terrible suddenness._ )
( arctic_a0089 _Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man._ )
( arctic_a0090 _He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling._ )
( arctic_a0091 _The night-glow was treacherous to shoot by._ )
( arctic_a0092 _The singing voice approached rapidly._ )
( arctic_a0093 _His blood grew hot with rage at the thought._ )
( arctic_a0094 _He went down in mid-stream, searching the shadows of both shores._ )
( arctic_a0095 _For a full minute he crouched and listened._ )
( arctic_a0096 _He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire._ )
( arctic_a0097 _A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision._ )
( arctic_a0098 _Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest._ )
( arctic_a0099 _Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow._ )
( arctic_a0100 _Shall I carry you._ )
( arctic_a0101 _A maddening joy pounded in his brain._ )
( arctic_a0102 _You must sleep, he urged._ )
( arctic_a0103 _You, you would not--keep the truth from me._ )
( arctic_a0104 _He will follow us soon._ )
( arctic_a0105 _But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe._ )
( arctic_a0106 _She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child._ )
( arctic_a0107 _Only, it is so wonderful, so almost IMPOSSIBLE to believe._ )
( arctic_a0108 _The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob._ )
( arctic_a0109 _If you only could know how I thank you._ )
( arctic_a0110 _He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself._ )
( arctic_a0111 _Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you._ )
( arctic_a0112 _Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely._ )
( arctic_a0113 _Instead, he joined her, and they ate like two hungry children._ )
( arctic_a0114 _He was wounded in the arm._ )
( arctic_a0115 _I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians._ )
( arctic_a0116 _Her words sent a strange chill through Philip._ )
( arctic_a0117 _He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him._ )
( arctic_a0118 _Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin._ )
( arctic_a0119 _She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice:_ )
( arctic_a0120 _Pierre obeys me when we are together._ )
( arctic_a0121 _Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward._ )
( arctic_a0122 _My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante._ )
( arctic_a0123 _They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours._ )
( arctic_a0124 _Two years ago I gave up civilization for this._ )
( arctic_a0125 _She had died from cold and starvation._ )
( arctic_a0126 _It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks._ )
( arctic_a0127 _He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself._ )
( arctic_a0128 _Each day she became a more vital part of him._ )
( arctic_a0129 _It was a temptation, but he resisted it._ )
( arctic_a0130 _This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born._ )
( arctic_a0131 _Her face was against his breast._ )
( arctic_a0132 _She was his now, forever._ )
( arctic_a0133 _Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom._ )
( arctic_a0134 _A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips._ )
( arctic_a0135 _Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength._ )
( arctic_a0136 _He obeyed the pressure of her hand._ )
( arctic_a0137 _I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre._ )
( arctic_a0138 _About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age._ )
( arctic_a0139 _Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure._ )
( arctic_a0140 _In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne._ )
( arctic_a0141 _He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes._ )
( arctic_a0142 _Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this._ )
( arctic_a0143 _It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God._ )
( arctic_a0144 _Such things had occurred before, he told Philip._ )
( arctic_a0145 _Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed._ )
( arctic_a0146 _But there was something even more startling than this resemblance._ )
( arctic_a0147 _I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily._ )
( arctic_a0148 _Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued._ )
( arctic_a0149 _A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness._ )
( arctic_a0150 _Now these things had been struck dead within him._ )
( arctic_a0151 _For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky._ )
( arctic_a0152 _Good-by, Pierre, he shouted._ )
( arctic_a0153 _And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare._ )
( arctic_a0154 _Philip thrust himself against it and entered._ )
( arctic_a0155 _MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger._ )
( arctic_a0156 _He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black._ )
( arctic_a0157 _Won't you draw up, gentlemen._ )
( arctic_a0158 _A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned._ )
( arctic_a0159 _He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice._ )
( arctic_a0160 _Does that look good._ )
( arctic_a0161 _They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life._ )
( arctic_a0162 _You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt._ )
( arctic_a0163 _Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub._ )
( arctic_a0164 _That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe._ )
( arctic_a0165 _Philip made no effort to follow._ )
( arctic_a0166 _He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne._ )
( arctic_a0167 _They are to attack your camp to- morrow night._ )
( arctic_a0168 _Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding._ )
( arctic_a0169 _I was near the cabin, and saw you._ )
( arctic_a0170 _Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting._ )
( arctic_a0171 _Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant._ )
( arctic_a0172 _There was none of the joy of meeting in his face._ )
( arctic_a0173 _And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen._ )
( arctic_a0174 _Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar._ )
( arctic_a0175 _The date was nearly eighteen years old._ )
( arctic_a0176 _They were the presage of storm._ )
( arctic_a0177 _Down there the earth was already swelling with life._ )
( arctic_a0178 _For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap._ )
( arctic_a0179 _She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled._ )
( arctic_a0180 _Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated._ )
( arctic_a0181 _To-morrow I'm going after that bear, he said._ )
( arctic_a0182 _If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed._ )
( arctic_a0183 _So cheer up, and give us your paw._ )
( arctic_a0184 _This time he did not yap for mercy._ )
( arctic_a0185 _And the air was growing chilly._ )
( arctic_a0186 _Don't you see., I'm chewing this thing in two._ )
( arctic_a0187 _The questions may have come vaguely in his mind._ )
( arctic_a0188 _Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl._ )
( arctic_a0189 _Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine._ )
( arctic_a0190 _Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass._ )
( arctic_a0191 _The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying._ )
( arctic_a0192 _Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent._ )
( arctic_a0193 _For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone._ )
( arctic_a0194 _He did not rush in._ )
( arctic_a0195 _It was edged with ice._ )
( arctic_a0196 _He drank of the water cautiously._ )
( arctic_a0197 _But a strange thing happened._ )
( arctic_a0198 _He began to follow the footprints of the dog._ )
( arctic_a0199 _Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose._ )
( arctic_a0200 _Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions._ )
( arctic_a0201 _Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day._ )
( arctic_a0202 _He leapt again, and the club caught him once more._ )
( arctic_a0203 _he cried, and swung the club wildly._ )
( arctic_a0204 _She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face._ )
( arctic_a0205 _They were following the shore of a lake._ )
( arctic_a0206 _The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him._ )
( arctic_a0207 _From now on we're pals._ )
( arctic_a0208 _He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau._ )
( arctic_a0209 _How much was it._ )
( arctic_a0210 _Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression._ )
( arctic_a0211 _It was not a large lake, and almost round._ )
( arctic_a0212 _Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards._ )
( arctic_a0213 _It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made._ )
( arctic_a0214 _Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman._ )
( arctic_a0215 _Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound._ )
( arctic_a0216 _Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head._ )
( arctic_a0217 _They die out of spite._ )
( arctic_a0218 _The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him._ )
( arctic_a0219 _Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive._ )
( arctic_a0220 _The ringing of the big bell aroused him._ )
( arctic_a0221 _At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened._ )
( arctic_a0222 _A dead man is of no use on a plantation._ )
( arctic_a0223 _I don't know why you're here at all._ )
( arctic_a0224 _What part of the United States is your home._ )
( arctic_a0225 _My, I'm almost homesick for it already._ )
( arctic_a0226 _She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist._ )
( arctic_a0227 _I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up._ )
( arctic_a0228 _That came before my A B C's._ )
( arctic_a0229 _It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles._ )
( arctic_a0230 _But it contributed to the smash._ )
( arctic_a0231 _The last one I knew was an overseer._ )
( arctic_a0232 _Do you know any good land around here._ )
( arctic_a0233 _The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia._ )
( arctic_a0234 _I cannot follow you, she said._ )
( arctic_a0235 _I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me._ )
( arctic_a0236 _Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod-liver oil._ )
( arctic_a0237 _His voice was passionately rebellious._ )
( arctic_a0238 _Don't you see I hate you._ )
( arctic_a0239 _So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves._ )
( arctic_a0240 _It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon._ )
( arctic_a0241 _he cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter._ )
( arctic_a0242 _Wash your hands of me._ )
( arctic_a0243 _I think it's much nicer to quarrel._ )
( arctic_a0244 _I saw it when she rolled._ )
( arctic_a0245 _I only read the quotations._ )
( arctic_a0246 _He was the soul of devotion to his employers._ )
( arctic_a0247 _Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year._ )
( arctic_a0248 _You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi._ )
( arctic_a0249 _They ought to pass here some time to-day._ )
( arctic_a0250 _I had been sad too long already._ )
( arctic_a0251 _All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy._ )
( arctic_a0252 _He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition._ )
( arctic_a0253 _I may manage to freight a cargo back as well._ )
( arctic_a0254 _O'Brien had been a clean-living young man with ideals._ )
( arctic_a0255 _He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino._ )
( arctic_a0256 _Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller._ )
( arctic_a0257 _You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that._ )
( arctic_a0258 _See the length of the body and that elongated neck._ )
( arctic_a0259 _They are coming ashore, whoever they are._ )
( arctic_a0260 _Soaked in sea-water they offset the heat-rays._ )
( arctic_a0261 _Think of investing in such an adventure._ )
( arctic_a0262 _NOBODY knew his history, they of the Junta least of all._ )
( arctic_a0263 _I have been doubly baptized._ )
( arctic_a0264 _They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha._ )
( arctic_a0265 _Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed._ )
( arctic_a0266 _And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young._ )
( arctic_a0267 _The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment._ )
( arctic_a0268 _They handled two men already, both grub-thieves._ )
( arctic_a0269 _Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow._ )
( arctic_a0270 _Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened._ )
( arctic_a0271 _That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands._ )
( arctic_a0272 _And after the bath a shave would not be bad._ )
( arctic_a0273 _Now please give a plain statement of what occurred._ )
( arctic_a0274 _You can take a vacation on pay._ )
( arctic_a0275 _They are big trees and require plenty of room._ )
( arctic_a0276 _And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house._ )
( arctic_a0277 _There are no kiddies and half-grown youths among them._ )
( arctic_a0278 _Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference._ )
( arctic_a0279 _McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin._ )
( arctic_a0280 _It would give me nervous prostration._ )
( arctic_a0281 _she said with chattering teeth._ )
( arctic_a0282 _I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes._ )
( arctic_a0283 _I do not blame you for anything, remember that._ )
( arctic_a0284 _If you mean to insinuate - Brentwood began hotly._ )
( arctic_a0285 _The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant._ )
( arctic_a0286 _There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes._ )
( arctic_a0287 _But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine._ )
( arctic_a0288 _Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping._ )
( arctic_a0289 _Keep an eye on him._ )
( arctic_a0290 _Those are my oysters, he said at last._ )
( arctic_a0291 _They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued._ )
( arctic_a0292 _One by one the boys were captured._ )
( arctic_a0293 _The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted._ )
( arctic_a0294 _Here, in the mid-morning, the first casualty occurred._ )
( arctic_a0295 _They were deep in the primeval forest._ )
( arctic_a0296 _He had been foiled in his attempt to escape._ )
( arctic_a0297 _And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows._ )
( arctic_a0298 _Bassett was a fastidious man._ )
( arctic_a0299 _There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts._ )
( arctic_a0300 _This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill._ )
( arctic_a0301 _I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tom-foolery and rot._ )
( arctic_a0302 _From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror._ )
( arctic_a0303 _But all my dreams violated this law._ )
( arctic_a0304 _It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis._ )
( arctic_a0305 _But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality._ )
( arctic_a0306 _I graduated last of my class._ )
( arctic_a0307 _They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs._ )
( arctic_a0308 _He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary._ )
( arctic_a0309 _Very early in my life, I separated from my mother._ )
( arctic_a0310 _His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it._ )
( arctic_a0311 _White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer._ )
( arctic_a0312 _Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply._ )
( arctic_a0313 _Therefore, hurrah for the game._ )
( arctic_a0314 _It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass._ )
( arctic_a0315 _Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain._ )
( arctic_a0316 _Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World._ )
( arctic_a0317 _Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy._ )
( arctic_a0318 _We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once._ )
( arctic_a0319 _He was a wise hyena._ )
( arctic_a0320 _Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself._ )
( arctic_a0321 _And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom:_ )
( arctic_a0322 _With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face._ )
( arctic_a0323 _The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift._ )
( arctic_a0324 _This is a common experience with all of us._ )
( arctic_a0325 _He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat._ )
( arctic_a0326 _It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily._ )
( arctic_a0327 _Whiz-zip-bang . Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish._ )
( arctic_a0328 _Cherokee identified himself with his instinct._ )
( arctic_a0329 _They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements._ )
( arctic_a0330 _The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves._ )
( arctic_a0331 _Ah, indeed._ )
( arctic_a0332 _Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed._ )
( arctic_a0333 _Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared._ )
( arctic_a0334 _Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm._ )
( arctic_a0335 _This is no place fer you._ )
( arctic_a0336 _He'll knock yeh off a few sticks in no time._ )
( arctic_a0337 _Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down._ )
( arctic_a0338 _So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet._ )
( arctic_a0339 _Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally._ )
( arctic_a0340 _The fighting had now become intermittent._ )
( arctic_a0341 _They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands._ )
( arctic_a0342 _It was like the beating of hoofs._ )
( arctic_a0343 _Why, dog-gone you-all, shake again._ )
( arctic_a0344 _Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago._ )
( arctic_a0345 _You mean for this State, General, Alberta._ )
( arctic_a0346 _He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality._ )
( arctic_a0347 _She was trying to pass the apron-string around him._ )
( arctic_a0348 _Get down and dig in._ )
( arctic_a0349 _They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound._ )
( arctic_a0350 _They only lifted seven hundred and fifty._ )
( arctic_a0351 _It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his._ )
( arctic_a0352 _Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing._ )
( arctic_a0353 _It was more like sugar._ )

( arctic_b0072 _Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him._ )
( arctic_b0073 _With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone._ )
( arctic_b0074 _Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive._ )
( arctic_b0075 _In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution._ )
( arctic_b0076 _Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him._ )
( arctic_b0077 _It is the nearest refuge._ )
( arctic_b0078 _There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice._ )

( arctic_b0084 _Your face is red with blood._ )
( arctic_b0085 _Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank._ )
( arctic_b0086 _He can care for himself._ )
( arctic_b0087 _They will search for us between their camp and Churchill._ )

( arctic_b0089 _Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils._ )
( arctic_b0090 _The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed._ )
( arctic_b0091 _For a full half-minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking._ )
( arctic_b0092 _I want to die in it._ )

( arctic_b0094 _And yet if she came he had no words to say._ )
( arctic_b0095 _He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day._ )
( arctic_b0096 _Within himself he called it no longer his own._ )
( arctic_b0097 _Besides, that noise makes me deaf._ )
( arctic_b0098 _Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe._ )
( arctic_b0099 _Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks._ )
( arctic_b0100 _There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne._ )
( arctic_b0101 _You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win._ )
( arctic_b0102 _I'll only be in the way._ )
( arctic_b0103 _He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips._ )
( arctic_b0104 _Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body._ )
( arctic_b0105 _I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows._ )
( arctic_b0106 _For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face._ )
( arctic_b0107 _He was sure, now--of but few things._ )
( arctic_b0108 _It was a miracle, and I owe you my life._ )
( arctic_b0109 _Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him._ )
( arctic_b0110 _Such men believe, when they come together._ )
( arctic_b0111 _The journey was continued at dawn._ )
( arctic_b0112 _Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock._ )
( arctic_b0113 _There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now._ )
( arctic_b0114 _He moved his position, and the illusion was gone._ )
( arctic_b0115 _For two hours not a word passed between them._ )
( arctic_b0116 _I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip._ )
( arctic_b0117 _That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer._ )
( arctic_b0118 _We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call._ )
( arctic_b0119 _Billinger may arrive in time._ )
( arctic_b0120 _There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette._ )
( arctic_b0121 _I want my men to work by themselves._ )
( arctic_b0122 _Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe._ )
( arctic_b0123 _Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men._ )
( arctic_b0124 _Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times._ )
( arctic_b0125 _It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear._ )
( arctic_b0126 _Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast._ )
( arctic_b0127 _He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman._ )
( arctic_b0128 _Philip bent low over Pierre._ )
( arctic_b0129 _Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill._ )
( arctic_b0130 _She saw the answer in his face._ )
( arctic_b0131 _Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you._ )
( arctic_b0132 _There is no need of further detail, now--for you can understand._ )
( arctic_b0133 _There followed a roar that shook the earth._ )
( arctic_b0134 _Blind with rage, he darted in._ )
( arctic_b0135 _In it was the joy of life._ )
( arctic_b0136 _Swiftly his eyes measured the situation._ )
( arctic_b0137 _But this little defect did not worry him._ )
( arctic_b0138 _And then, steadily, he began to chew._ )
( arctic_b0139 _Together they ate the rabbit._ )
( arctic_b0140 _They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world._ )
( arctic_b0141 _It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits._ )
( arctic_b0142 _Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now._ )
( arctic_b0143 _It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it._ )
( arctic_b0144 _But there was no longer the mother-yearning in his heart._ )
( arctic_b0145 _Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest._ )
( arctic_b0146 _After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment._ )
( arctic_b0147 _Had it struck squarely it would have killed him._ )
( arctic_b0148 _The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce._ )
( arctic_b0149 _Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur._ )
( arctic_b0150 _And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear._ )
( arctic_b0151 _It was steel, a fisher trap._ )
( arctic_b0152 _OW, a wild dog, he growled._ )
( arctic_b0153 _He was a pariah, a wanderer without a friend or a home._ )
( arctic_b0154 _That is the strange part of it._ )
( arctic_b0155 _His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor._ )
( arctic_b0156 _For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight._ )
( arctic_b0157 _In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle._ )
( arctic_b0158 _She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms._ )
( arctic_b0159 _His teeth shut with a last click._ )
( arctic_b0160 _It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators._ )
( arctic_b0161 _In a flash he was on his feet, facing him._ )
( arctic_b0162 _He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders._ )
( arctic_b0163 _The moon had already begun its westward decline._ )
( arctic_b0164 _They laughed like two happy children._ )
( arctic_b0165 _He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back._ )
( arctic_b0166 _FAST, but ENDURE._ )
( arctic_b0167 _A little before dawn of the day following the fire relief came._ )
( arctic_b0168 _The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart._ )
( arctic_b0169 _He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them._ )
( arctic_b0170 _Then he shouted, Shut up._ )
( arctic_b0171 _He changed his seat for a steamer reclining-chair._ )
( arctic_b0172 _On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded._ )
( arctic_b0173 _To these he gave castor-oil._ )
( arctic_b0174 _Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing._ )
( arctic_b0175 _Sheldon glanced at the thermometer._ )
( arctic_b0176 _I'll see to poor Hughie._ )
( arctic_b0177 _Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering._ )
( arctic_b0178 _Also, I want information._ )
( arctic_b0179 _Let them go out and eat with my boys._ )
( arctic_b0180 _I, I beg pardon, he drawled._ )
( arctic_b0181 _And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge-belt._ )
( arctic_b0182 _I was in New York when the crash came._ )
( arctic_b0183 _No, I did not fall among thieves._ )
( arctic_b0184 _Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips._ )
( arctic_b0185 _Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me._ )
( arctic_b0186 _I can't go elsewhere, by your own account._ )
( arctic_b0187 _Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation._ )
( arctic_b0188 _He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips._ )
( arctic_b0189 _That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals._ )
( arctic_b0190 _Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off._ )
( arctic_b0191 _He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons._ )
( arctic_b0192 _Outsiders are allowed five-minute speeches, the sick man urged._ )
( arctic_b0193 _So was Packard's finish suicide._ )
( arctic_b0194 _Joan cried, with shining eyes._ )
( arctic_b0195 _Nobody knows how the natives got them._ )
( arctic_b0196 _How can you manage all alone, Mr Young._ )
( arctic_b0197 _The planters are already considering the matter._ )
( arctic_b0198 _I use great trouble advisedly._ )
( arctic_b0199 _Dear Sir,, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time._ )
( arctic_b0200 _We leave the eventuality to time and law._ )
( arctic_b0201 _I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe._ )
( arctic_b0202 _Society is shaken to its foundations._ )
( arctic_b0203 _A month in Australia would finish me._ )
( arctic_b0204 _Down through the perfume-weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods._ )
( arctic_b0205 _You were destroying my life._ )
( arctic_b0206 _Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery._ )
( arctic_b0207 _I'm as good as a man, she urged._ )
( arctic_b0208 _You read the quotations in to-day's paper._ )
( arctic_b0209 _He's terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them._ )
( arctic_b0210 _Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi._ )
( arctic_b0211 _This is 1880._ )
( arctic_b0212 _Death is and has been ever since old Maui died._ )
( arctic_b0213 _SOME boy, she laughed acquiescence._ )
( arctic_b0214 _Let us talk it over and find a way out._ )
( arctic_b0215 _It is a good property, and worth more than that._ )
( arctic_b0216 _I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted._ )
( arctic_b0217 _Such is my passage engaged on the steamer._ )
( arctic_b0218 _The issue was not in doubt._ )
( arctic_b0219 _Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all._ )
( arctic_b0220 _Harry Bancroft, Dave lied._ )
( arctic_b0221 _It's a Yankee, Joan cried._ )
( arctic_b0222 _He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant._ )
( arctic_b0223 _They likewise are disinclined to being eaten._ )
( arctic_b0224 _But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta._ )
( arctic_b0225 _The President of the United States was his friend._ )
( arctic_b0226 _Your face was the personification of duplicity._ )
( arctic_b0227 _Shorty turned to their employers._ )
( arctic_b0228 _You were engaged, _ )
( arctic_b0229 _I saw it all myself, and it was splendid._ )
( arctic_b0230 _Now run along, and tell them to hurry._ )
( arctic_b0231 _What's that grub-thief got to do with it._ )
( arctic_b0232 _It was a superb picture._ )
( arctic_b0233 _So she said, the irate skipper dashed on._ )
( arctic_b0234 _And watch out for wet feet,' was his parting advice._ )
( arctic_b0235 _Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard._ )
( arctic_b0236 _Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land._ )
( arctic_b0237 _They just lay off in the bush and plugged away._ )
( arctic_b0238 _The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating._ )
( arctic_b0239 _And there was a dog that barked._ )
( arctic_b0240 _There are four, all low, McCoy answered._ )
( arctic_b0241 _The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley._ )
( arctic_b0242 _The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand._ )
( arctic_b0243 _They had been on the same lay as ourselves._ )
( arctic_b0244 _You are positively soulless, he said savagely._ )
( arctic_b0245 _Harrison is still my chauffeur._ )
( arctic_b0246 _The boy grew and prospered._ )
( arctic_b0247 _He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone._ )
( arctic_b0248 _Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol:_ )
( arctic_b0249 _I know they are my oysters._ )
( arctic_b0250 _By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek._ )
( arctic_b0251 _They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents._ )
( arctic_b0252 _It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne._ )
( arctic_b0253 _The very opposite is true, they are discouraged vagabonds._ )
( arctic_b0254 _At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders._ )
( arctic_b0255 _Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him._ )
( arctic_b0256 _Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect._ )
( arctic_b0257 _Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust._ )
( arctic_b0258 _You fired me out of your house, in short._ )
( arctic_b0259 _Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh._ )
( arctic_b0260 _It's worth eight dollars._ )
( arctic_b0261 _And he did hurt my arm._ )
( arctic_b0262 _Saxon's onto her job._ )
( arctic_b0263 _Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another._ )
( arctic_b0264 _But this time it was Saxon who rebelled._ )
( arctic_b0265 _I was not to cry out in the face of fear._ )
( arctic_b0266 _And now put yourself in my place for a moment._ )
( arctic_b0267 _The boy threw back his head with pride._ )
( arctic_b0268 _Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned._ )
( arctic_b0269 _Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot._ )
( arctic_b0270 _We could throw stones with our feet._ )
( arctic_b0271 _It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way._ )
( arctic_b0272 _These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter._ )
( arctic_b0273 _Then it was that a strange thing happened._ )
( arctic_b0274 _From the source of light a harsh voice said:_ )
( arctic_b0275 _But I did not enjoy it long._ )
( arctic_b0276 _We were now good friends._ )
( arctic_b0277 _Two of the Folk were already up._ )
( arctic_b0278 _Now animals do not like mockery._ )
( arctic_b0279 _He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees._ )
( arctic_b0280 _Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried:_ )
( arctic_b0281 _Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion._ )
( arctic_b0282 _Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured._ )
( arctic_b0283 _But we were without this momentum._ )
( arctic_b0284 _There was one difficulty, however._ )
( arctic_b0285 _The hyena proceeded to dine._ )
( arctic_b0286 _The time was considered auspicious._ )
( arctic_b0287 _Or have they already devised one._ )
( arctic_b0288 _We would not spend another such night._ )
( arctic_b0289 _At first his progress was slow and erratic._ )
( arctic_b0290 _He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated._ )
( arctic_b0291 _The awe of man rushed over him again._ )
( arctic_b0292 _The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders._ )
( arctic_b0293 _Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities._ )
( arctic_b0294 _For a much longer time Lop-Ear and I remained and watched._ )
( arctic_b0295 _All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret._ )
( arctic_b0296 _At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style._ )
( arctic_b0297 _Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round._ )
( arctic_b0298 _His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-Leg by the neck._ )
( arctic_b0299 _Miss Brodie's smile was slightly sarcastic._ )
( arctic_b0300 _Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way._ )
( arctic_b0301 _A flying arrow passed between us._ )
( arctic_b0302 _I pulled, suddenly, with all my might._ )
( arctic_b0303 _Here we allow our solicitors to look after our legal work._ )
( arctic_b0304 _His previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children._ )
( arctic_b0305 _It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp._ )
( arctic_b0306 _Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers._ )
( arctic_b0307 _We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish-eaters._ )
( arctic_b0308 _We never made another migration._ )
( arctic_b0309 _Nor was Elam Harnish an exception._ )
( arctic_b0310 _A little treatment, massage, with some help from the doctor._ )
( arctic_b0311 _The 29th very foggy._ )
( arctic_b0312 _Dig in, you're sure good, was Daylight's answer._ )
( arctic_b0313 _The apron-string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt._ )
( arctic_b0314 _He had been born with this endowment._ )
( arctic_b0315 _And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal._ )
( arctic_b0316 _Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun._ )
( arctic_b0317 _He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury._ )
( arctic_b0318 _Again he had done the big thing._ )
( arctic_b0319 _Daylight was tired, profoundly tired._ )
( arctic_b0320 _The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter._ )
( arctic_b0321 _Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day._ )
( arctic_b0322 _Their supply of grub was gone._ )
( arctic_b0323 _Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead._ )
( arctic_b0324 _Not till the twentieth of May did the river break._ )
( arctic_b0325 _It was a gigantic inadequacy._ )
( arctic_b0326 _Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel._ )
( arctic_b0327 _He had been so easy._ )
( arctic_b0328 _Change chairs, Daylight commanded._ )
( arctic_b0329 _I'd sooner have my chips back._ )
( arctic_b0330 _They only had a little thirty- thousand-dollar fire._ )
( arctic_b0331 _His partners had starved and died on the Stewart._ )

( arctic_b0333 _It does, was her audacious answer._ )
( arctic_b0334 _Oh, it's just a novel, a love-story._ )
( arctic_b0335 _Whoever lived on the ranch did that._ )
( arctic_b0336 _How old are you, mother._ )
( arctic_b0337 _Here he got a fresh thrill._ )
( arctic_b0338 _It was unobtrusive, yet it was there._ )
( arctic_b0339 _Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned._ )
( arctic_b0340 _These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him._ )
( arctic_b0341 _I play that choice wide open to win._ )
( arctic_b0342 _Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up._ )
( arctic_b0343 _But how are you going to do it._ )
( arctic_b0344 _Lots of men take women buggy-riding._ )
( arctic_b0345 _Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him._ )
( arctic_b0346 _There's not an iota of truth in it._ )
( arctic_b0347 _But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano._ )
( arctic_b0348 _Would you be satisfied with that one-hundredth part of me._ )
( arctic_b0349 _In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell._ )
